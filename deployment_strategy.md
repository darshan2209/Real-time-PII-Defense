Part 2: Deployment Strategy (Markdown)Deployment Strategy for PII DetectorWe need to determine where this detector should be placed across the stack for optimal efficiency.Architectural Choice: Sidecar Pattern at the Application LayerWhy Sidecar?1. Scalability: Runs alongside each application pod (e.g., with Kubernetes), ensuring PII is sanitized before being sent or stored.2. Ease of Integration: Does not require rewriting existing business logicâ€”just intercepts API/DB traffic.3. Latency: Close to the application, avoiding network round-trip (vs. network-level proxies).4. Cost-effective: Reuses existing cluster infrastructure.DesignA. Input Flow:-The application produces logs or user data into CSV/JSON.The sidecar process intercepts these records.Processing:-Runs the PII Detector (Python service in this challenge).Identifies and redacts PII fields.B. Output Flow:-Outputs sanitized logs/data (CSV/DB writes).Adds the is_pii column for auditing.Deployment Options:-DaemonSet (Node-wide): If data is centralized/logged across nodes.Sidecar Container (App-specific, preferred): Deployed adjacent to each application microservice pod.API Gateway Plugin (Optional): If we want to filter traffic at ingress/egress (higher latency but global enforcement).Scaling &amp; Operations:-Auto-scale replicas based on traffic volume.Central monitoring via Prometheus + Grafana.CI/CD pipeline to ensure the detector stays updated (new regex/rules).Recommendation:-1. Use the Sidecar Container model for real-time compliance at the app boundary.2. Periodically run a batch mode job (cron job) for offline CSV/database cleanup.3. Integration can be hybrid:Sidecar for real-time transactions,Batch job for historical/audit compliance.This balances latency, compliance, and operational cost.
